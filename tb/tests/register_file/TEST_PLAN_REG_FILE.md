# Test Plan for Register File (register_file.sv)

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 DUT Information
- **Module**: `rtl/core/register_file.sv`
- **Interface**: `rtl/common/interfaces/register_file_if.sv`
- **Parameters**:
  - XLEN: Register width (default: 32)
  - ADDR: Address width (default: 5 for 32 registers)

### 1.2 Functional Description
The register file is a key component of the RISC-V processor pipeline, providing:
- 32 general-purpose registers (x0-x31)
- Dual asynchronous read ports (RS1, RS2)
- Single synchronous write port (RD)
- Register x0 hardwired to zero
- Write operations occur on positive clock edge
- Read operations are combinational

## 2. Verification Strategy
### 2.1 Verification Components
1. **Transaction Class** (`reg_transaction.sv`)
   - Defines register operations (READ_RS1, READ_RS2, WRITE_RD)
   - Includes randomization and constraints
   - Provides utility methods for comparison and debug

2. **Driver** (`reg_driver.sv`)
   - Converts transactions to pin-level activity
   - Handles timing for read/write operations

3. **Monitor** (`reg_monitor.sv`)
   - Observes interface activity
   - Creates transactions from observed behavior

4. **Scoreboard** (`reg_scoreboard.sv`)
   - Maintains reference model
   - Verifies DUT behavior
   - Tracks register values

## 3. Test Cases
### 3.1 Basic Functionality Tests
1. **Reset Verification**
   - Description: Verify all registers are zero after reset
   - Stimulus: Assert reset signal
   - Expected: All registers read as 0x00000000
   - Coverage: Reset signal assertion

2. **Register Zero (x0) Tests**
   - Description: Verify x0 always reads as zero
   - Stimulus: Write non-zero values to x0
   - Expected: Reading x0 always returns 0x00000000
   - Coverage: x0 write attempts, x0 read values

3. **Single Register Write/Read**
   - Description: Write and read back from single register
   - Stimulus: Write unique pattern to each register
   - Expected: Read value matches written value
   - Coverage: All registers written/read

### 3.2 Concurrent Operation Tests
1. **Simultaneous Reads**
   - Description: Read from both ports simultaneously
   - Stimulus: Configure different RS1/RS2 addresses
   - Expected: Both ports return correct values
   - Coverage: All register pair combinations

2. **Write-Read Forwarding**
   - Description: Read immediately after write
   - Stimulus: Write followed by read to same register
   - Expected: Read returns newly written value
   - Coverage: Write-read transitions

### 3.3 Corner Cases
1. **Back-to-Back Writes**
   - Description: Sequential writes to same register
   - Stimulus: Multiple writes to same address
   - Expected: Final write value persists
   - Coverage: Consecutive write operations

2. **Address Toggle Coverage**
   - Description: Toggle register addresses
   - Stimulus: Alternate between min/max addresses
   - Expected: Correct data for each address
   - Coverage: Address transitions

### 3.4 Error Cases
1. **Invalid Address Handling**
   - Description: Access invalid register addresses
   - Stimulus: Addresses > 31
   - Expected: Defined behavior (implementation specific)
   - Coverage: Invalid address detection

## 4. Coverage Goals
### 4.1 Functional Coverage
- 100% register address coverage
- All operation types exercised
- Write-read sequences covered
- Reset state verified
- x0 behavior verified

### 4.2 Code Coverage
- 100% line coverage
- 100% branch coverage
- 100% toggle coverage for control signals
- 100% FSM coverage (if applicable)

## 5. Success Criteria
1. All test cases pass
2. Coverage goals met
3. No outstanding issues
4. All assertions pass
5. No timing violations

## 6. Implementation Guidelines
### 6.1 Test Creation Steps
1. Create new test class inheriting from base_test
2. Define test sequence in run() method
3. Add coverage points if needed
4. Add to regression suite

### 6.2 Example Test Implementation
```systemverilog
class reg_basic_test extends reg_base_test;
    task run();
        reg_transaction trans = new();
        
        // Basic write-read test
        void'(trans.randomize() with {
            op_type == WRITE_RD;
            addr != 0;
        });
        
        // Send to driver
        drv_mbx.put(trans);
        
        // Verify read
        trans.op_type = READ_RS1;
        drv_mbx.put(trans);
    endtask
endclass
```
