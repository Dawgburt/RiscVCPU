# Test Plan for Memory Access (memory_access.sv)

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 DUT Information
- **Module**: `memory_access.sv`
- **Interfaces**: 
  - `memory_writeback_if`
  - `execute_memory_if`
  - `memory_fetch_if`
- **Key Features**:
  - Data memory operations (Load/Store)
  - Load Memory Data (LMD) updates
  - Conditional program counter updates

## 2. Test Implementation
### 2.1 Components
1. **Interfaces**
   - `memory_writeback_if`: Handles memory operations and data transfer
   - `execute_memory_if`: Provides ALU results and zero flag
   - `memory_fetch_if`: Manages program counter updates

2. **Test Driver** (`memory_access_tb.sv`)
   - Controls clock generation
   - Drives interface signals
   - Implements test scenarios
   - Provides display task for monitoring

## 3. Test Cases
### 3.1 Reset Test (Test 1)
- Assert reset signal
- Verify LMD initialized to zero
- Verify proper reset behavior

### 3.2 Memory Write Test (Test 2)
- Write data (0xABCD1234) to address 0x4
- Verify write enable signal functionality
- Check timing of write operation

### 3.3 Memory Read Test (Test 3)
- Read from previously written address (0x4)
- Verify correct data retrieval
- Check LMD update timing

### 3.4 Multiple Location Test (Tests 4-5)
- Write new data (0x87654321) to different address (0x8)
- Read from new location
- Verify data integrity across different addresses

### 3.5 Conditional PC Test (Test 6)
- Test branch behavior with zero flag set/unset
- Verify conditional PC updates
- Check proper selection between branch target and next PC

## 4. Expected Behavior
### 4.1 Memory Operations
- Write operations occur on positive clock edge when WE is high
- Read operations update LMD when RE is high
- Data persists until overwritten
- Proper address handling for read/write operations

### 4.2 Program Counter Updates
- condpc updates based on zero flag
- Selects between ALU result and next PC
- Updates occur synchronously with clock

## 5. Success Criteria
1. Reset properly initializes all signals
2. Memory writes store correct data at specified addresses
3. Memory reads retrieve correct data
4. LMD updates correctly during read operations
5. Conditional PC updates properly based on zero flag
6. All timing requirements met

## 6. Debug Features
- Comprehensive display task showing:
  - Current time
  - Reset state
  - Write/Read enable signals
  - Memory address
  - Data values
  - Read data
  - LMD value
  - Conditional PC value

## 7. Verification Process
1. Execute reset test sequence
2. Perform memory write operations
3. Verify read operations
4. Test multiple memory locations
5. Verify conditional branching
6. Check timing requirements
7. Monitor and log all operations
